title: 'My thought about NextJS as a Java developer'

I'm just a normal college student who just had learnt Java and want to experiment on other framework, particularly Javascript framework
because JS ecosystem is madness, JS is very flexible so a lot of library and framework have been built around JS, popular among them are:

- ReactJS
- Angular
- VueJS

ReactJS had grow from small open source library to become the industry standard to create modern, flexible, maintainable UI on the frontend, but there is some 
problem, it is very hard to set up a config new React app although the community have come up with solution like CRA (create-react-app), there is one solution that can help developer to save their development time on building the app rather than spent long hours config it, and it is [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
